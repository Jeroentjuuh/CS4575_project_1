# Energy Consumption Comparison: Web Browser vs Native Jellyfin App.
## Introduction
Energy efficiency is a growing concern all over the world, and as sofware and AI develops in giant steps, it is also a concern in the software development area. As applications become more resource-intensive, understanding the energy consumption of different software configurations is essentail. In this experiment, we compare the energy consumption of streaming a small piece of a movie using the Jellyfin web browser interface versus the Jellyfin native application. By measuring the energy consumption of these two approaches, we aim to identify which method is more energy-efficient and under which circumstances.
This study follows a systematic methodology to ensure unbiased and replicable energy measurements. The results of this experiment will help users and developers make informed decisions about optimizing software for energy efficiency.
